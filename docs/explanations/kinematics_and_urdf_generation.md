# Kinematics and URDF Generation

How Denavit-Hartenberg parameters, bore detection, forward kinematics, and
inverse kinematics interact to produce correct URDF joint origins, visual
origins, and simulation.

## DH Parameters

The **Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) convention** describes the kinematic chain of a
serial robot as a sequence of four parameters per joint:

| Parameter | Symbol | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Joint angle | θ | Rotation about the Z axis (variable for revolute joints) |
| Link offset | d | Translation along the Z axis |
| Link length | a | Translation along the X axis |
| Link twist | α | Rotation about the X axis |

Each (θ, d, a, α) tuple defines the homogeneous transform from frame *i−1*
to frame *i*.  Manufacturers publish these tables in datasheets — for example,
the UR5 datasheet gives:

| Joint | θ | d (mm) | a (mm) | α (rad) |
|-------|---|--------|--------|---------|
| 1 | 0 | 89.159 | 0 | π/2 |
| 2 | 0 | 135.85 | −425.0 | 0 |
| 3 | 0 | −119.7 | −392.25 | 0 |
| 4 | 0 | 109.15 | 0 | π/2 |
| 5 | 0 | 94.65 | 0 | −π/2 |
| 6 | 0 | 82.3 | 0 | 0 |

### Mapping DH to URDF

In URDF, each `<joint>` has an `<origin xyz="..." rpy="...">` that positions
the child frame relative to the parent frame.  The DH parameters map to these
as follows:

- **d** → translation along the parent Z axis
- **a** → translation along the (rotated) X axis
- **α** → rotation about the X axis (maps to `rpy`)

The exact mapping depends on axis conventions, but the key point is: **DH
parameters define the distance between consecutive joint axes**, measured
center-to-center through the link.

## Bore Geometry

A **bore** is a cylindrical opening in a robot link where a joint shaft or
bearing is inserted.  Each link typically has two bores:

- **Proximal bore**: where the link connects to the parent joint
- **Distal bore**: where the link connects to the child joint

### Face vs Center

Bore detection can report two positions along the bore axis:

- **Bore face**: the flat surface at the opening of the cylindrical bore.
  This corresponds to the bounding-box extreme along the bore axis — where the
  link material actually starts/ends.

- **Bore center** (barrel center): the geometric midpoint of the barrel
  cross-section along the bore axis.  This is where the actual joint rotation
  axis passes through.

```
                  bore axis
                     │
     ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
     │               │               │
     │   ┌───────────┼───────────────┤ ← bore face (bbox extreme)
     │   │           │    barrel     │
     │   │           ●───────────────┤ ← bore center (bbox midpoint)
     │   │           │               │
     │   └───────────┼───────────────┤
     │               │               │
     └───────────────┼───────────────┘
                     │
              ← r →  ← r →
              (half barrel diameter)
```

The face and center differ by approximately half the barrel diameter,
typically 50–70 mm on UR-sized robots.

## Forward Kinematics (FK)

**Forward kinematics** is the process of computing the position and orientation
of every link in the robot given a set of joint angles.  It is the direct
consumer of DH parameters: FK walks the kinematic chain from base to tip,
multiplying 4×4 homogeneous transforms at each joint to accumulate the
world-frame pose of every link.

For each joint in the chain the transform is:

```
T_child = T_parent × T_origin × R_joint(θ)
```

where:

- **T_origin** is the fixed offset from the parent frame to the joint frame,
  derived from the DH parameters (d, a, α) and stored in the URDF as
  `<joint><origin xyz="..." rpy="...">`.
- **R_joint(θ)** is the rotation produced by the current joint angle θ around
  the joint axis.

Starting from the base link at identity, FK multiplies these transforms
sequentially to produce a dictionary of `link_name → 4×4 matrix` in world
coordinates.  The translation column of the final matrix is the end-effector
position; the rotation sub-matrix is its orientation.

### Relationship to the other concepts on this page

| Concept | Role in FK |
|---------|-----------|
| **DH parameters** | Source of the fixed joint-origin transforms (T_origin) |
| **Bore geometry** | Determines the *visual* mesh offset so that rendered links align with the FK-computed frames — FK itself only uses DH-derived origins, not bore positions |
| **URDF joint origins** | The concrete encoding of DH parameters that FK reads at runtime |
| **Visual origins** | Shift meshes so the proximal bore center coincides with the frame origin that FK computes for that link |

In short: DH parameters define *where* each joint frame sits, bore geometry
defines *how* the mesh is shifted to match, and FK multiplies the chain of
joint-frame transforms to get world-space poses for simulation and rendering.

## Inverse Kinematics (IK)

**Inverse kinematics** is the reverse of FK: given a desired end-effector
position (and optionally orientation), find the set of joint angles that
achieves it.  While FK has a unique closed-form solution — multiply transforms
down the chain — IK is generally harder:

- There may be **multiple solutions** (a 6-DOF arm can often reach the same
  point with different elbow/wrist configurations).
- There may be **no solution** (the target is outside the workspace).
- For general robots the problem is solved **numerically** rather than
  analytically.

This project uses a custom **damped least-squares** (DLS) solver built on the
geometric Jacobian.  It computes the 6×N Jacobian analytically from the URDF
joint chain and iteratively drives both position and orientation error to zero.
The solver takes:

1. A **4×4 target pose matrix** (position + orientation) in world coordinates.
2. The **current joint angles** as an initial guess to seed the iteration and
   bias toward nearby solutions.

It returns a new set of joint angles whose FK result places the end-effector
at (or near) the target pose, or ``None`` if the solver does not converge.

### How IK relates to the other concepts on this page

| Concept | Role in IK |
|---------|-----------|
| **DH parameters** | Define the kinematic model that IK must invert — link lengths and twists determine the reachable workspace |
| **FK** | The IK solver evaluates FK internally on every iteration to compute the Jacobian and measure the current error |
| **URDF** | The solver reads joint origins, axes, and limits directly from the URDF model — correct joint origins (from DH) are essential for accurate IK |
| **Bore geometry** | Not directly involved — IK operates on joint-space kinematics, not visual mesh positioning |

The IK solver lives in `src/robot_arm_sim/simulate/ik_solver.py`.

## How They Connect

**DH distances measure center-to-center**, not face-to-face.

When bore detection reports *face* positions, the face-to-face distance
between two connected bores is shorter than the DH distance by the sum of the
two half-barrel offsets at each end.

             r1                          r2

  DH distance = face-to-face + r1 + r2
  gap = DH distance − face-to-face distance = r1 + r2
```

## Effect on URDF Generation

### Joint origins (kinematics)

Joint origins come directly from DH parameters (or the manufacturer chain
spec).  They are **not affected** by bore position definition — they always
measure the correct center-to-center distance.

### Visual origins (rendering)

Visual origins shift each mesh so that its reference point aligns with its
frame origin.  We use the **proximal bore** as the reference point: negate its
position to shift the mesh so the proximal bore lands at (0, 0, 0).

- **Using face positions**: the mesh is shifted so the proximal bore *face* is
  at the origin.  But DH distances measure to the bore *center*, so the mesh
  sits offset by half a barrel diameter, creating a visible gap.

- **Using center positions**: the mesh is shifted so the proximal bore
  *center* (barrel midpoint) is at the origin.  This matches the DH distance
  convention, closing the gap.

We compute the bore center by finding the opposite flat face along the bore
axis and averaging the two positions:

```python
bore_axis = anchor.get("axis", [0, 0, 0])
axis_idx = max(range(3), key=lambda i: abs(bore_axis[i]))
centering = anchor.get("centering", "surface")

if centering == "center" and abs(bore_axis[axis_idx]) > 0.5:
    opp = _find_opposite_face(analysis, pos.tolist(), bore_axis, axis_idx)
    if opp is not None:
        pos[axis_idx] = (pos[axis_idx] + opp) / 2
```

## UR5 Worked Example: Shoulder → Upperarm

Consider the connection between shoulder (link_1) and upperarm (link_2)
at joint_2, which has DH parameter d₂ = 135.85 mm along Y.

**Shoulder distal bore** (on link_1):
- Bore axis: Y
- Face position: Y = 70.5 mm (bbox extreme)
- Center position: Y ≈ 5.4 mm (bbox midpoint)

**Upperarm proximal bore** (on link_2):
- Bore axis: Y
- Face position: Y = −65.2 mm (bbox extreme)
- Center position: Y ≈ 1.7 mm (bbox midpoint)

**With face positioning**:
- Shoulder mesh ends at Y = 70.5 mm (face)
- Upperarm mesh starts at Y = −65.2 mm in its own frame
- After joint_2 translation of 135.85 mm, the upperarm face is at
  135.85 − 65.2 = 70.65 mm → flush with shoulder face (0.15 mm gap)
- But the mesh is only shifted to its face, not its center, leaving the
  visual center of the barrel offset from the joint axis

**With center positioning**:
- Shoulder mesh is centered at Y ≈ 5.4 mm
- Upperarm mesh center at Y ≈ 1.7 mm → shifted to origin
- After joint_2 translation, meshes overlap by the barrel thickness,
  producing the correct visual appearance with the joint axis passing
  through the barrel center on both sides

## How the pipeline uses these concepts

The URDF generation pipeline uses DH parameters for joint origins and
connection points for visual origins. For details on how each pass works,
